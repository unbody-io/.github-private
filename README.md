const query = "A movie director";
const prompt = "Explain why these information are related to each other.";

const queries = [
  // Google Docs
	unbody.get.googleDoc.limit(3)
                      .search.about(query)
                      .generate.fromMany(prompt, ["title","autoSummary"]),

  // Paragraphs
	unbody.get.textBlock.limit(3)
                      .search.about(query)
                      .generate.fromMany(prompt, ["text"]),

  // PDFs, .DocX, .RTF
  unbody.get.textDocument.limit(3)
                      .search.about(query)
                      .generate.fromMany(prompt, ["title","autoSummary"])

  // Images
  unbody.get.imageBlock.limit(3)
                      .search.about(query)
