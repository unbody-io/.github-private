  // Google Docs
	unbody.get.googleDoc.limit(3)
                      .search.about(query)
                      .generate.fromMany(prompt, ["title","autoSummary"]),

                      .search.about(query)
                      .generate.fromMany(prompt, ["text"]),

  // PDFs, .DocX, .RTF
  unbody.get.textDocument.limit(3)
                      .search.about(query)
